## Important Notes

- **Anti-Virus Warnings**: Some anti-virus software may flag this trainer as malicious. I assure you that this is a false positive. The trainer was compiled using the latest version of Cheat Engine, and it contains no viruses—just sweet game hacks.
- **Usage Guidelines**: This trainer is intended for use **only on your own private server with people you know**. I do not condone cheating on public servers. Please use responsibly.
- **Pointer Accuracy**: While the pointers and offsets used for health and stamina are correct about 90% of the time, you might need to restart the game for the correct pointers to populate the cheats. I will do more testing to find pointers that are accurate 99-100% of the time and will release an update when I do.
